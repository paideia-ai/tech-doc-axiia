    This is the point that I am gonna say in a separate Markdown file and then use it to check your understanding of the screen. I'm going to give you the context for how our test is built.

  So basically for each test event, we have a bunch of people taking our test. Then for each test event, we would select pick some problems which have their problem ID. We have some fixed dimensions like
  ability to iterate and ability to reveal. So there is a correlation between problems and dimensions, and that could be a customizable relation. We have some injection and surjection between these two sets of
   problems and dimensions. The dimensions of fits and problems are selected from a large pool. After a bunch of people, like for a group, like a hundred people in the group A, taking the test, we compute a
  curve based upon all the reports, like all the original raw scores. The raw score includes the problem score, which is like the scoring for the final submission of the problem, but it also includes the
  ability score which for each problem will compute an ability score for that problem. But of course it only has related ability dimensions. And then we take ability score from all problems and give a final
  average. That will be the total - that's the final ability score for this specific test participant.

  And then at last we have one - we have like the final score for each dimension, we have a final score for each problem. Then we will average and get a total problem score and a total ability score. And then
  we'll take a geometric mean of these two scores to get a final true score. We will do curve basically by one standard deviation above average is A, one standard deviation within that is B, same for C and D.
  And for each dimension, each problem score we will do the curve, and we'll do the curve for the raw total scores as well. Then we compute curve, and the most common case is that we compute the curve and
  apply it back to the original self people who we kept the curve from. But it's also possible that we use a already got curve to some other group of test participants, but there are some conditions that need
  to be met. If you want to do that, for example, you have similar problems, you need to cover similar dimensions, and you need to use similar scoring prompts, etc.
