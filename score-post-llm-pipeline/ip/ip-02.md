1 a report that has not been curved does not have letter grade
2 in order to create a curve, we need a bunch of scores
3 in order to apply a curve, we can have only one
4 the report json still have many other field, for example the comments, the pros and cons of the test participants, let us start the input from report-score, rather than the original complete report, so that we will have curved score+grade and non-curved score , these are two schemas
